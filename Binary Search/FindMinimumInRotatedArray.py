Question;

You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:

    [3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
    [1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.

Notice that rotating the array 4 times moves the last four elements of the array to the beginning. Rotating the array 6 times produces the original array.
Assuming all elements in the rotated sorted array nums are unique, return the minimum element of this array.
A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        start , end = 0, len(nums) - 1 
        curr_min = float("inf")
        
        while start  <  end :
            mid = start + (end - start ) // 2
            curr_min = min(curr_min,nums[mid])
            
            # right has the min 
            if nums[mid] > nums[end]:
                start = mid + 1
                
            # left has the  min 
            else:
                end = mid - 1 
                
        return min(curr_min,nums[start])
