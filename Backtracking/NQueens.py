Question;

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other.
A queen in a chessboard can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
Each solution contains a unique board layout where the queen pieces are placed. 'Q' indicates a queen and '.' indicates an empty space.
You may return the answer in any order.
