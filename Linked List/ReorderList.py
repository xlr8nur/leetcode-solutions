Question;

You are given the head of a singly linked-list.
The positions of a linked list of length = 7 for example, can intially be represented as:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Reorder the nodes of the linked list to be in the following order:
[0, 6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3]
Notice that in the general case for a list of length = n the nodes are reordered to be in the following order:
[0, n-1, 1, n-2, 2, n-3, ...]
You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, but instead you must reorder the nodes themselves.

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
        # find middle
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # reverse second half
        second = slow.next
        prev = slow.next = None
        while second:
            tmp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = tmp

        # merge two halfs
        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = tmp1
            first, second = tmp1, tmp2
