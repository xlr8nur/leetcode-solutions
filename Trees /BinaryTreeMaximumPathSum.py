Question;

Given the root of a non-empty binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has an edge connecting them. A node can not appear in the sequence more than once. The path does not necessarily need to include the root.
The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

class Solution:
    def maxPathSum(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        res = [root.val]

        # return max path sum without split
        def dfs(root):
            if not root:
                return 0

            leftMax = dfs(root.left)
            rightMax = dfs(root.right)
            leftMax = max(leftMax, 0)
            rightMax = max(rightMax, 0)

            # compute max path sum WITH split
            res[0] = max(res[0], root.val + leftMax + rightMax)
            return root.val + max(leftMax, rightMax)

        dfs(root)
        return res[0]
