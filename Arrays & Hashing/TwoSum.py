Question;

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices i and j such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.
You may assume that every input has exactly one pair of indices i and j that satisfy the condition.
Return the answer with the smaller index first.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        prevMap = {}  # val -> index

        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - n
            if diff in prevMap:
                return [prevMap[diff], i]
            prevMap[n] = i
