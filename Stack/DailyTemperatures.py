'''   
Question;

You are given an array of integers temperatures where temperatures[i] represents the daily temperatures on the ith day.
Return an array result where result[i] is the number of days after the ith day before a warmer temperature appears on a future day. If there is no day in the future where a warmer temperature will appear for the ith day, set result[i] to 0 instead.

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        res = [0] * len(temperatures)
        stack = []  # pair: [temp, index]

        for i, t in enumerate(temperatures):
            while stack and t > stack[-1][0]:
                stackT, stackInd = stack.pop()
                res[stackInd] = i - stackInd
            stack.append((t, i))
        return res
