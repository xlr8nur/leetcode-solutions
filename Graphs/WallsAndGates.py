'''
Question;

You are given a m×nm×n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:

    -1 - A water cell that can not be traversed.
    0 - A treasure chest.
    INF - A land cell that can be traversed. We use the integer 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF.

Fill each land cell with the distance to its nearest treasure chest. If a land cell cannot reach a treasure chest than the value should remain INF.
Assume the grid can only be traversed up, down, left, or right.
