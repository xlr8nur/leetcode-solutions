Question;

You are given a connected undirected graph with n nodes labeled from 1 to n. Initially, it contained no cycles and consisted of n-1 edges.
We have now added one additional edge to the graph. The edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that previously existed in the graph.
The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] represents an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.
Return an edge that can be removed so that the graph is still a connected non-cyclical graph. If there are multiple answers, return the edge that appears last in the input edges.

            while p != par[p]:

                p = par[p]

        # return False if already unioned
        def union(n1, n2):
            p1, p2 = find(n1), find(n2)

            if p1 == p2:
                return False
            if rank[p1] > rank[p2]:

                par[p1] = p2
                rank[p2] += rank[p1]
            return True
