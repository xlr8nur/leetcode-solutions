Question;

Given a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy of the graph.
Each node in the graph contains an integer value and a list of its neighbors.

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}

The graph is shown in the test cases as an adjacency list. An adjacency list is a mapping of nodes to lists, used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.
For simplicity, nodes values are numbered from 1 to n, where n is the total number of nodes in the graph. The index of each node within the adjacency list is the same as the node's value (1-indexed).
The input node will always be the first node in the graph and have 1 as the value.

class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: "Node") -> "Node":
        oldToNew = {}

        def dfs(node):
            if node in oldToNew:
                return oldToNew[node]

            copy = Node(node.val)
            oldToNew[node] = copy
            for nei in node.neighbors:
                copy.neighbors.append(dfs(nei))
            return copy

        return dfs(node) if node else None
