Question;

You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] represents the weight of the ith stone.

We want to run a simulation on the stones as follows:

    At each step we choose the two heaviest stones, with weight x and y and smash them togethers
    If x == y, both stones are destroyed
    If x < y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.

Continue the simulation until there is no more than one stone remaining.

Return the weight of the last remaining stone or return 0 if none remain.

class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        stones = [-s for s in stones]
        heapq.heapify(stones)

        while len(stones) > 1:
            first = heapq.heappop(stones)
            second = heapq.heappop(stones)
            if second > first:
                heapq.heappush(stones, first - second)

        stones.append(0)
        return abs(stones[0])
